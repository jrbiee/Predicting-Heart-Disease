# Predicting-Heart-Disease
This project is on the prediction of heart disease. This project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on these features. The reason this project was chosen is not only because heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but it also runs my family. 

The reason this analysis is important is if heart disease can be predicted early based on key metrics, the hope is to decrease the mortality rate. This beneficial for those with heart disease, predisposed to heart disease, scientists, researchers, tech companies for developing monitoring and detection technologies, and app companies.

The process of this analysis begins importing the necessary packages and goes as follows: 
1. The next step is importing the data
2. Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
3. Data pre-processing to split the data into training and testing sets
4. Statistical models to form a baseline for recall, accuracy, precision   and f1 score. This sets the stage for the neural network.
5. Model Visualizations and Feature Importance
6. Building the Neural Network
7. Comparing the best performing model to the neural network
8. Result for Neural Network
9. Visualizations
10. Overall results and Conclusion
